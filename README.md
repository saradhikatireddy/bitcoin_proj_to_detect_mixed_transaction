This project is a Bitcoin transaction tracking tool designed to analyze and identify potentially fraudulent transactions, with a focus on detecting transactions related to illegal activities such as drug trafficking. The tool leverages taint analysis and integrates a machine learning model to detect suspicious transactions and mixing services that may be used to launder funds.

Features
Taint Analysis: Tracks the flow of Bitcoin from a specific address through the network, calculating the percentage of "taint" associated with each address and transaction.
Mixing Service Detection: Identifies potential mixing services based on heuristic analysis, flagging nodes with a high number of outgoing transactions.
Machine Learning Integration: Uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of transactions being fraudulent based on features extracted from the transaction graph.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bitcoin-Transaction-Tracker.git
cd Bitcoin-Transaction-Tracker
Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Blockchain API:

Obtain an API key from a blockchain data provider (e.g., Blockchain.com).
Replace the placeholder API key in the Blockchain class with your actual key.
Usage
Initialize the Tracker:
Create an instance of the TaintTracker class by providing a Bitcoin address that you suspect is involved in illegal activities.

python
Copy code
from tracker import TaintTracker

initial_address = 'your-bitcoin-address'
tracker = TaintTracker(initial_address)
Analyze Taint:
Run the analyze_taint() method to generate a taint graph, which tracks the flow of tainted funds through the network.

python
Copy code
taint_graph = tracker.analyze_taint()
Detect Mixing Services:
Use the detect_mixing_services() method to identify potential mixing services within the taint graph.

python
Copy code
suspicious_nodes = tracker.detect_mixing_services(taint_graph)
print("Suspicious nodes:", suspicious_nodes)
Machine Learning Prediction:
If you have trained a machine learning model, you can integrate it into the tracker to predict fraudulent transactions.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load your trained model
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

# Integrate the model with the tracker
tracker = TaintTracker(initial_address, model)
Example
Here's an example of how you can run the tracker:

python
Copy code
from tracker import TaintTracker

# Initialize with a suspicious Bitcoin address
tracker = TaintTracker('1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa')

# Analyze the taint
taint_graph = tracker.analyze_taint()

# Detect suspicious nodes (potential mixing services)
suspicious_nodes = tracker.detect_mixing_services(taint_graph)

print("Suspicious nodes detected:", suspicious_nodes)
Data Sources
Blockchain API: The tool interacts with blockchain data providers (e.g., Blockchain.com) to retrieve transaction data.
Machine Learning Model: If using machine learning, the model should be trained on historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
